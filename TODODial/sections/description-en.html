<span class="markdown">
The TODO Dialogue module deals with the concepts used for dialogue modelling, both for
dialogue management and dialogue tracing. For this module, the knowledge covering the former is intended to be implemented as static, and the latter as dynamic, as it will be instantiated during the dialogue process.</span>

<p>Figure 1 shows a simple overview of the main relations in the TODO Dialogue module, in which TODODT (purple) and TODODM (magenta) are distinguished.</p>
